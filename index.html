					<h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>
					<funParagraph>DBZ was the first anime I was introduced to as a child. Being one of the more light hearted anime in terms of cultural/societal topics it touches on. One of the most known anime with a central focus on the Z-Fighters as they protect earth and their universe from outside forces. DBZ primary focus would be personal growth. Showing time and time again how characters will start as villians but as they grown and build upon the characters depth we are able to see characters such as Piccolo, Vegeta, Buu and others go from antagonist to best friends of the stories hero Goku.</funParagraph>

					<h2>YuYu Hakusho</h2>
					<funParagraph>2nd on the list and a all time favorite would be YuYu Hakusho. Similar to DBZ in premise and societal commentary. YuYu hakuso is built around the story of Yuske yuremeshi a high school deliquent who selflessly saves a childs life at the cost of his own, this selfless act introduces Yuske to Boton the angel of death and a spirit from the Underworld. The shows primary focus would be personal development with the story starting out with Yuske doing something thats viewed by those around him as out of his personality. The story continues to show the growth of Yuske and his group of friend Kurama, Kuwabara and Hiei all of which start off as enemies to Yuske. The show also tackles moral ideologies in the later season when the show pivots from having demons as their enemies to humans.</funParagraph>

					<h2>Samurai Champloo</h2>

					<h2>Avatar</h2>
					<funParagraph> The story of Aang the avatar of the four elements. In Avatar the Last Airbender the Nickleoden series did a great presenting the social issues of sexism, authoritariasm and genocide in a very child friendly way. The premise of the is Aang is the savoir and Avatar(an individual who can master all four bending elements); the elements are Air, Fire, Earth and Water. After having been frozen from 100 years Aang awakens to find the Fire Nation has wiped out the Air nomads and begun to wage war with the two other nations. Avatar would also present one of the best redemption arcs in literature through Aang's initial rival Fire Nation prince Zuko. Zuko starts the story in efforts to capture Aang for the Fire Nation, as the story progresses we a given access to Zukos inner conflict between his family dynamic an his morality,</funParagraph>

					<h2>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h2>
					<funParagraph>We find ourselves following Edward and Alphonse, brothers who lost their mother and parts of themself when they attempted to use Alchemy to bring her back. This anime presents the view the the acknowledgement of there's no such thing as a painless lesson. In order to gain anything, you must lose something first. We learn from our mistakes, we grow from our experiences, and sometimes that means getting hurt. There is nothing that can equal the value of a human life, in FMAB they live by the rules of equivelent exchange; the ability to change one thing to another with the use of alchemy. That is for anything excepting creating/bringing people to life.</funParagraph>

					<h2>One Piece</h2>
					<funParagraph>Here we have the longest running of all the anime on this list. In the fictional world where pirates wage battles agains the world government. One Piece follows the story of Luffy a 17yr who sets out to be the king of pirates. On the surface with a goofy animation styling and comedic relief filled in every episode on the surface, underneath that facade we find a show that takes on authoritariasm, slavery, morality, caste systems, genocide and the dark side of human nature. </funParagraph>

					<h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
					<funParagraph>The story starts with the island of Paridis. We find what appers to be last remaining humans in a dystopian story where they are being hunted by giants. This idea later implodes on itself as the story of Paridis and Eren Yeager are explored. Only for the island to find its not the last remaining humans but the supject of societies oppression in a game of world politics. With the full ideals of the series coming into question as the story develops. AOT has the most similaries with FMAB where they dig into the human nature of the character; bringing both the dark and light sides of the characters to the forfront of the show. </funParagraph>
